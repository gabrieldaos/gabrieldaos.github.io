This capstone project deals with analyzing where the attention of the Filipino people lie with regards to the news tweets being published daily. Ridge regression was used to make the predictions of a tweet's performance (Likes & Tweets) from tweets that were converted to TFIDF vectors.



**How the project came to be**

As a daily social media user in the Philippines, I noticed that the Bea, Julia, and Gerald scandal (A scandal between these celebrities in our country) took over social media on the same week that our President gave his State of the Nation Address. Despite having lots of nationwide issues brought up in that SONA, people were more concerned about who cheated on whom between the 3 celebrities I mentioned earlier.

Because of the scenario that happened, I wanted to explore this hypothesis:

## Filipinos are interested in celebrities than social issues that the country has.

By exploring this hypothesis, we'll figure out by using machine learning **how we can get Filipinos more engaged with the relevant problems in the Philippines**.

Based from a recent statistic made last January 2019, roughly 61% of Filipinos that are using social media are on the ages of 18 - 34. We now live in a age where people would tune into their smartphones to get the latest news updates instead of their television. This is why I'll be using twitter as a medium for this study.

In order to confirm the hypothesis, we'll need to answer these three questions in order to understand what's currently going on in social media:

1. Which news tweets has gathered most of the Filipino's attention this 2019 (Up til September since that's when the project was made.)
2. How are these popular tweets similar to one another, like what features do they have that gives them attention
3. Can a machine learning model predict a tweet's performance based from what's established from the 2 questions before?

Here's a useless table:

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
