This capstone project deals with analyzing where the attention of the Filipino people lie with regards to the news tweets being published daily. Ridge regression was used to make the predictions of a tweet's performance (Likes & Tweets) from tweets that were converted to TFIDF vectors.



**How the project came to be**

As a daily social media user in the Philippines, I noticed that the Bea, Julia, and Gerald scandal (A scandal between these celebrities in our country) took over social media on the same week that our President gave his State of the Nation Address. Despite having lots of nationwide issues brought up in that SONA, people were more concerned about who cheated on whom between the 3 celebrities I mentioned earlier.

Because of the scenario that happened, I wanted to explore this hypothesis:

## Filipinos are interested in celebrities than social issues in our country.

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
